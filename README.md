# Stock Prediction using Machine Learning Algorithms
The stock market is one of the most complicated and lucrative businesses. Predicting  stock  trends  is  a  cumbersome task,  as  the  stock  market  is  very  dynamic  and  composedof  various  factors.  The  main  factors  involved  are  Physical, Psychological, Rational, Irrational behavior, etc. Here, four ML algorithms to predict stock price were applied.

1. Neural Network computation framework
2. Time series analysis using ARIMA
3. Support Vector Regression models: Linear Regression, Polynomial and Radical Basic Function models
4. Naive-Bayes clustering model
